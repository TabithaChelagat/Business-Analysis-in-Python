# Business-Analysis-in-Python

# INTRODUCTION

In this analysis, we aim to uncover various insights from our store data, using Python, to better understand customer behavior and trends. By examining different factors and their relationships, we can make informed decisions to enhance our marketing strategies, optimize sales, and improve customer satisfaction. The key areas of focus in this analysis include:

- **Income Groups**: Analysis of purchasing patterns across different income levels.
- **Age Groups**: Exploration of how age influences purchase recency and behavior.
- **Marital Status**: Examination of purchasing activity based on marital status.
- **Complaints**: Impact of complaints on purchasing behavior.
